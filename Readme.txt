This package provides an implementation of Conditional Tree-structured Bayesian Networks [Batal, Hong, Hauskrecht 2013] that builds structured prediction models for multi-label classification.

To train a model, use CTBN/learn_output_tree_sw.m. To use a trained model for prediction, use CTBN/MAP_prediction_sw.m.

demo.m contains a demonstration script that learns and uses the CTBN models on the emotions dataset.
